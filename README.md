# Sinatra Projects

This is a collection of tiny web apps built with [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/). The idea was to revisit old command-line programs I wrote in Ruby earlier in the course and convert them to web apps. 

I might add more projects to this later on. For now I was only interested in the framework side of things so I haven't added any styling yet, keeping the apps text-based for now.

## Guess the Number

This is my version of the [WebGuesser tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html) from Jumpstart Labs, which I did previously to learn the basics of Sinatra.
